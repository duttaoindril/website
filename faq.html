                    <p>Anybody! Our Hackathon specifically targets high schoolers new to programming, but everybody &amp; anybody is welcome! Ideas don't grow on trees, so it's perfectly fine if you
                       don't have an idea when you come to Teen Hackathon. Most hackers have no clue of what they will build, yet many still win!</p>

                       hackathon is to learn new things &amp; meet new people!</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, as high schoolers, our hardware support is limited. <a href = "http://duttaoindril.github.io/website/#footer">Contact us</a> for more details regarding your specific goals so we

                    <p>No, not really; but it would be awesome if you did! Since we are using challenge post to submit hacks, you can submit off-site if you decide to not attend. Also
                       keep in mind that
                       the hackathon will be closed off to all inbound or outbound traffic from 10PM to 7AM, so unless you hack overnight better at home, stay, &amp; have some
                       fun!</p>

                    <p>Great! This will be a fun AND novel experience for you! As mentioned before, no experience is required. A hackathon is a great place to meet new people of many
                       types, &amp; learn a lot from the entire experience &amp; people met. We would be honored to make your first hackathon Teen Hackathon.</p>
